# Kubebuilder Example
Small project to demo how to build a Kubernetes controller with Kubebuilder.

There is no real usecase for this controller, the idea was just to include web requests in the controller to show how the controller can have external dependencies. Hopefully work will continue and integrate towards a complex API in the future.
